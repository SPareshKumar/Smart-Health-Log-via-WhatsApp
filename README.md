## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User Sends a Message via WhatsApp**
   - The user sends a text like:  
     - `"homemade salad at 1 pm"`  
     - `"30 pushups"`  
     - `"pizza from Swiggy at 9 pm"`

2. **Message is Received and Processed**
   - A backend service (powered by Twilio API) receives the WhatsApp message.
   - The system identifies whether the message is food-related or activity-related.

3. **Log Entry is Created**
   - The message is timestamped and categorized (e.g., meal, workout).
   - The entry is stored in a structured format 

4. **User Can Track Progress**
   - Logs are organized daily.
   - Data can be used to visualize trends, generate summaries, or offer recommendations.
